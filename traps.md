# Traps

When stocking a dungeon, there is a 1 in 6 chance for a room to have a
trap.

Searching has a base 2 in 6 chance to spot a trap, and there is a base 2
in 6 chance (per creature) to trigger a trap. The Judge may rule that a trap resets in 1d6 rounds, turns, hours, etc. as appropriate.

When a trap is indicated, roll a d6 and consult the result against the
level of the dungeon (depth) in question. This will give you the
"Threat Rank" (I -- VI) of the trap.

Finally roll a d12 and match the result to the given Threat Rank.

## Trap Descriptions

### Pit Traps
The basic pit is a 10’×10’×10' hole hidden by a cover unless noted. When triggered, victims must save vs. stone or fall in (generally affecting two characters). This results in 1d6 points of falling damage (save again for half). The Judge should familiarize themselves with the rules for Forcing Doors, Swimming, etc. For deeper dungeon levels (where the dungeon level is greater than trap rank), add 10' to pit depth (+1d6 damage) per level difference. 
Optionally, convert any pit to a chute to a lower level.

**Pit**: As described above, victims must save vs. stone to avoid falling damage as described above.

**Pit; Locking**: This pit has a lid that closes behind the victims. The mechanisim can not be opened from inside without magic. Someone outside must force the cover: Force Door (2 in 6 + Strength Bonus).

**Pit; Spiked**: The spikes at the bottom do and additional 1d6 damage on top of the fall damage.

**Pit; Spiked**, Poison: The Spikes do 1d6 damage in addition to fall damage and are coverd with poison. If the save for half fall damage is failed, the victim must then save vs. death.

**Pit; Locking, Monster**: This pit has a lid that closes behind the victims. The mechanisim can not be opened from inside without magic.

A torrent of liquid forces victim to bottom (drowning damage 1d3/round); victims require outside assistance to escape (AC 2 to grab pole or rope and be pulled out).

**Pit; Locking, Crushing**: The pit lid closes behind the victim, and can not be opened from within, except with magic. An outside character must Force Door (2 in 6 + Strength Bonus). The walls start crushing in 1d3 rounds, which then requires a save vs. death each round thereafter.

Confining traps are typically normal appearing rooms that restrict movement. The Judge should familiarize themselves with the rules for Forcing Doors, Swimming, etc. 

**Net**: A net with hooks and bells drops from the ceiling, landing in 10’ × 20’ area, entangling those beneath. Those in the net cannot move, suffer a -2 penalty to AC, and can only make melee attacks with swords and spears at a -2 penalty. Creatures have a 1 in 6 plus Strength bonus chance per round to escape. Having a dagger in-hand grants a +2 to this roll. Check for nearby monsters when net falls.

**Portcullis**: An iron gate falls behind party and blocks the passage, the sound of which triggers a check for nearby monsters. The bars may be forced as locked door.

Those in the area must save vs. breath each round to avoid the effect of the gas. The gas clears after one hour.

**Gas; Obscuring**: A acrid hazy gas fills the area, imposing a –4 penalty to attacks.
