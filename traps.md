# Traps

## Trap Determination
When stocking a dungeon, there is a 1 in 6 chance for a room to have a
trap.

Searching has a base 2 in 6 chance to spot a trap, and there is a base 2
in 6 chance (per creature) to trigger a trap. The Judge may rule that a trap resets in 1d6 rounds, turns, hours, etc. as appropriate.

When a trap is indicated, roll a d6 and consult the result against the
level of the dungeon (depth) in question. This will give you the
"Threat Rank" (I -- VI) of the trap.




|**Dungeon Depth**|**d6 Result**|      |       |      |     |      |
|:----------------------|:-----------:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:---:|:----:|
|1                      |1-4          |5     |6      |      |     |      |
|2                      |1-2          |3-4   |5      |6     |     |      |
|3-4                    |1            |2     |3-4    |5     |6    |      |
|5-7                    |             |1     |2      |3-4   |5    |6     |
|8-10                   |             |      |1      |2     |3-4  |5-6   |
|11                     |             |      |       |1     |2    |3-6   |
|**Threat Rank**        |**I**        |**II**|**III**|**IV**|**V**|**VI**|

Finally roll a d12 and match the result to the given Threat Rank.

|       |**Trap by Threat Rank**|                   |                         |                         |                           |                                     |

## Trap Descriptions

### Pit Traps
The basic pit is a 10’×10’×10' hole hidden by a cover unless noted. When triggered, victims must save vs. stone or fall in (generally affecting two characters). This results in 1d6 points of falling damage (save again for half). The Judge should familiarize themselves with the rules for Forcing Doors, Swimming, etc. For deeper dungeon levels (where the dungeon level is greater than trap rank), add 10' to pit depth (+1d6 damage) per level difference. 
Optionally, convert any pit to a chute to a lower level.

**Pit**: As described above, victims must save vs. stone to avoid falling damage as described above.

**Pit; Locking**: This pit has a lid that closes behind the victims. The mechanisim can not be opened from inside without magic. Someone outside must force the cover: Force Door (2 in 6 + Strength Bonus).

**Pit; Spiked**: The spikes at the bottom do an additional 1d6 damage on top of the fall damage.

**Pit; Spiked, Poison**: The Spikes do 1d6 damage in addition to fall damage and are covered with poison. If the save for half fall damage is failed, the victim must then save vs. death.

**Pit; Locking, Monster**: This pit has a lid that closes behind the victims. The mechanisim can not be opened from inside without magic. Someone outside must force the cover: Force Door (2 in 6 + Strength Bonus). Roll for a random unintelligent monster appropriate for dungeon level living within.

**Pit; Spiked, Poison, Locking, Flooding**: Fall damage, 1d6 damage from spikes, which are covered in poison. Tf the save for half fall damage is failed, victim must then save vs. death. The pit lid closes behind the victim, and can not be opened from within, except with magic. An outside character must Force Door (2 in 6 + Strength Bonus). A torrent of liquid forces victim to bottom (drowning damage 1d3/round); victims require outside assistance to escape (AC 2 to grab pole or rope and be pulled out).

**Pit; Open, Spiked**: This pit is not covered, so PCs will not fall into it accidentally unless running, pushed, etc.; The spikes at the bottom do an additional 1d6 damage on top of the fall damage.

**Pit; Watery**: This pit is near filled with water or some other mundane liquid. Victims must succeed a swim check to stay afloat. Failure by 2 pips results in sinking/drowning.

**Pit; Monster**: Roll for random unintelligent monster appropriate to the dungeon level to inhabit the pit.

**Pit; Flooding**: A torrent of liquid forces victim to bottom (drowning damage 1d3/round); victims require outside assistance to escape (AC 2 to grab pole or rope and be pulled out).

**Pit; Locking, Flooding**: The pit lid closes behind the victim, and can not be opened from within, except with magic. An outside character must Force Door (2 in 6 + Strength Bonus). A torrent of liquid forces victim to bottom (drowning damage 1d3/round); victims require outside assistance to escape (AC 2 to grab pole or rope and be pulled out).

**Pit; Locking, Crushing**: The pit lid closes behind the victim, and can not be opened from within, except with magic. An outside character must Force Door (2 in 6 + Strength Bonus). The walls start crushing in 1d3 rounds, which then requires a save vs. death each round thereafter.

### Shooting Traps

### Clubbing and Crushing Traps

Clubbing traps are concealed within the architectural elements of the structure. 

**Ball Trap**: Countless steel balls drop to the floor, the sound of which triggers a check for nearby monsters. Anyone moving through the area must save vs. stone or fall and be stunned (unable to move or act) for 1d3 rounds. It takes 1d6 rounds for the balls to dissipate, ending the effect.

**Royal Statue**: A statue of a king or other nobility swings at the character with its scepter, attacking at +6 and inflicting 2d6 damage.

**Collapsing Wall**: The outer layer of blocks on this wall collapse in 5’ deep by 10' long area causing 8d6 damage, those affected can save vs. stone for half.

**Compacting Room**: The doors to this room are reinforced and will swing shut and lock. If they are spiked open beforehand, the spikes have a 4 in 6 chance to hold. The walls will close in 1d6+1 rounds causing 12d6 damage before retracting. Victims can save vs. death for half damage.

**Crushing Wall**: This solid outer section of wall flips forward inflicting 16d6 damage to a 5’ deep x20’ long area, and then retracts. Victims can save vs death for half.

### Confining Traps

Confining traps are typically normal appearing rooms that restrict movement. The Judge should familiarize themselves with the rules for Forcing Doors, Swimming, etc. 

**Net**: A net with hooks and bells drops from the ceiling, landing in 10’ × 20’ area, entangling those beneath. Those in the net cannot move, suffer a -2 penalty to AC, and can only make melee attacks with swords and spears at a -2 penalty. Creatures have a 1 in 6 plus Strength bonus chance per round to escape. Having a dagger in-hand grants a +2 to this roll. Check for nearby monsters when the net falls.

**Portcullis**: An iron gate falls behind party and blocks the passage, the sound of which triggers a check for nearby monsters. The bars may be forced as locked door.

**Watery Room**: The floor of the room is flooded with stagnant water at least 10' deep.

**Spinning Wall**: A section of wall up to 20’ in length spins in place, depositing the victims in area on the opposite side. It cannot be triggered from the other side. 

**Flooding Room**: The doors to this room are reinforced and will swing shut and lock. If they are spiked open beforehand, the spikes have a 4 in 6 chance to hold. Once sealed, the room floods with water in 1d6 rounds. Once fully flooded, attempts to open the door are at –2.

**Dropping Ceiling**: The entire stone ceiling of the room drops when triggered inflicting, 12d6 damage to the occupants, who can save vs. death for half. Passage through the room is then blocked.

### Gas Traps

The basic gas trap afflicts a 20 × 20' area with a hissing sound and distinct smell. When triggered characters can make a save vs. stone, allowing them to immediately flee the affected area. Those in the area must save vs. breath each round to avoid the effect of the gas. The gas clears after one hour.

**Gas; Obscuring**: A acrid hazy gas fills the area, imposing a –4 penalty to attacks.

**Gas; Sickness**: This sulfurous smelling gas causes the victims to lose 1d6 points of Strength unless a save vs. breath is made.  The lost Strength will recover an hour after leaving the gaseous area. 

**Gas; Blinding**: This apple scented gas inflicts blindness. Sight is restored an hour after leaving the area. 

**Gas; Poison**: This bitter almond scented gas forces the victims to save vs. death with a +4 bonus.

**Gas; Corroding**: This ammonia smelling gas will rust any metal items in the area. Each item must succeed a save vs. stone or it falls to pieces. Magic items get +2 bonus for each magic plus or ability.

**Gas, Insanity**: This fruity smelling gas causes the victim to become permanently insane unless a save vs. breath is successful. Those affected are equally likely to attack or flee from allies in any given encounter. A remove curse spell will lift the affliction.

### Energy/Magic Traps

While these traps may make use of magical effects, they are triggered and detected in the same manner as other traps. Some mechanical interface activates the magic, which is undetectable until that time.

**Boiling Oil**: Boiling oil dumps into a 10’ radius area inflicting 2d6 points of fire damage. The targets can make a save vs. breath for half damage.

**Fire Vent**: Flames belch out into a 10’ radius inflicting 4d6 points of fire damage. The targets can make a save vs. breath for half damage.

**Spells**: These traps work as per the spell description, at the lowest level required to cast. Targets must Save vs Wand where applicable. Trap-conjured Elementals are 8 HD (small). For deeper dungeon levels (where the dungeon level is greater than trap rank), add +2 to the caster level per degree of difference.
