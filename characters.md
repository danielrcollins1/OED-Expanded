## Ability Scores

Prior to the selection of character race and class, one should determine ability scores.

### Generation

Roll abilities 3d6 in order, then add 3 points among any scores desired (max 18). 

### Modifiers

In OED the modifiers from your ability scores affect the attributes listed below.

- *Strength*: Melee Attacks and Melee Damage
- *Intelligence*: Secret Door and Trap Detection
- *Wisdom*: Saves vs. Mental Attacks
- *Dexterity*: Missile Attacks and Armor Class
- *Constitution*: Hit Die Rolls
- *Charisma*: Reaction Rolls

|Score   |Modifier|
|--------|---|
|0-2     |-3 |
|3-5     |-2 |
|6-8     |-1 | 
|9-12    | 0 |
|13-15   |+1 |
|16-18   |+2 |
|19-21   |+3 |
|22-24   |+4 |
|Every 3 |(+1) |

**Experience Points**: In OED, ability scores do not affect XP earned.

## Languages

**Known Languages**: Characters start with Common and their own racial language (if nonhuman). They may specify other languages, as determeind by Intelligence bonus, at creation or later. The maximum number of extra languages learned is 1 per point of Intelligence above 10. We recommend assigning any new languages during downtime between adventures.  Note that PCs are assumed to be literate in any of their known languages.

**Common**: Common represents the standard Human language of the region. 

**Alignment Languages** Alignment/divisional tongues are _not_ known automatically; they must be learned like any other language. Usually this is only done by agents, officers, or subjugated populations of specific powers. 

 
## Alignment

OED features 3 alignment options:

- *Lawful* beings want civilization peaceful and expanding; they take prisoners, pay taxes, obey the king.
- *Neutral* beings seek a balance, or are simply disinterested.
- *Chaotic* beings want civilization broken down and destroyed; the never take prisoners and stab each other in the back. PCs should list their alignment as either neutral or lawful and secretly inform the DM.

**Spell Casting**: Standard "Vancian" magic; Only 1 instance of a spell can be memorized at a time.

**Spellbook**: Wizards start with a spellbook containing all 1st level spells. Each level of spells requires its own book. Replacement or duplicate spellbooks require time and expense, the same as learning spells.

**Learning Spells**: Adding a new spell from a book or scroll requires a roll of d20 + Wizard Level + Int modifier ≥ 20. Requires 1 day per spell level (3 tries per spell).

**Spell Research**: Requires 1 week per spell level and a roll of d20 + Wizard Level + Int Modifier ≥ 20. Access to a library or other resources grant a +4 to the roll.

**Magic Item Creation**: Takes 1 day and 100SP per spell level/charge/use and the ability to cast the relevant spell(s). 

The Judge will secretly roll a 1 in 20 chance for a mishap/cursed item.

*Note*: Treat Potions of Healing as a 1st level spell, and Mithridate as a 4th level spell.

### Multi Classing

**Adding Classes**: A character must have a 16 or greater in the Prime Requisite of the new class (Strength for Fighter, Dexterity for Thieves, Intelligence for Wizards), and must pay 1000xp to add the new class.

*Note*: Elves begin play as a member of the Wizard class and either Fighter or Thief, without needing to meet the above requirements.

**Experience Points**: After each adventure, the character applies all earned XP to a single class of their choice.

**Benefits of Multiclassing**:

-   Uses best entry for Armor.
-   Uses best entry for Weapons.
-   Uses best value for Attacks
-   Uses highest class for Saves,
-   Keep a separate HP tally for each class and use the higher of the two for your character's HP.
-   Fighter/Wizards may cast spells in Light (Leather) and Medium (Chain) armor as long as they do not employ a shield.
-   Fighter/Wizards may cast spells so long as they only wield 1 handed melee weapon, and have a free hand.
-   Thief skills can only be used in Light (Leather) armor.
