The DM will secretly roll a 1 in 20 chance for a mishap/cursed item.

### Multi Classing

**Adding Classes**: A character must have a 16 or greater in the Prime Requisite of the new class (Strength for Fighter, Dexterity for Thieves, Intelligence for Wizards), and must pay 1000xp to add the new class.\
*Note*: Elves begin play as a member of the Wizard class and one other without needing to meet the above requirements.

**Experience Points**: After each adventure, the character applies all earned XP to a single class of their choice.

**Benefits of Multiclassing**:

-   Uses best entry for Armor.
-   Uses best entry for Weapons.
-   Uses best value for Attacks
-   Uses highest class for Saves,
-   Keep a separate HP tally for each class and use the higher of the two for your character's HP.
-   Fighter/Wizards may cast spells in Light (Leather) and Medium (Chain) armor as long as they do not employ a shield.
-   Fighter/Wizards may cast spells so long as they only wield 1 handed melee weapon, and have a free hand.
-   Thief skills can only be used in Light (Leather) armor.

## Alignment

OED features 3 alignment options:

-   *Lawful* beings want civilization peaceful and expanding; they take prisoners, pay taxes, obey the king.
-   *Neutral* beings seek a balance, or are simply disinterested.
-   *Chaotic* beings want civilization broken down and destroyed; the never take prisoners and stab each other in the back. PCs should list their alignment as either neutral or lawful and secretly inform the DM.
