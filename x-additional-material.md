## Arcana Obscura

Below is a summary of Cleric, Druid, and Magic User spells not included
in [OED Book of Spells](http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/original-edition-delta-book-of-spells-2nd-edition/15995854).
They can be used for GMs who wish to include other kinds of spell-casters, or diversify their villains.

For even more spells, a GM can reference the 
[Wizard's Spell Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17468/Wizards-Spell-Compendium-Vol-1-2e),
using the above spells as a guideline for streamlining the entry.

**Turn Undead**: A Cleric may brandish their Holy Symbol in order repel the Undead. When doing so, the player rolls 1d6 + (Cleric Level -- 5), with the result being the highest Hit Die of Undead affected. Up to 2d6 such creatures are affected (lowest Hit Die first). If the Cleric's level exceeds the Undead's Hit Dice by 4 or more, the Undead is reduced to 0 HP instead. Such an ability works to a range of 60', once per day
per given creature(s).

An Example Notation for a Cleric 10: "Turn Undead: HD = d6+5; 2d6 creatures, destroy 6HD or below."

**Spell Casting**: Standard "Vancian" magic; Only 1 instance of a spell can be prepared at a time (no duplicates). To cast a spell a Cleric must brandish their holy symbol with a free hand.

## Creatures
### Familiars
A Familiar is a spirit that takes on the form of a small animal to provide magical knowledge to a mortal. In practice, they function as a special sort of “hireling” for magic users. Statistics are the same as the animal form except

**Alignment**: d6; 1 (Lawful), 2-3 (Neutral), 4-6 (Chaotic)

**Intelligence**: 2d6+6

**Saves**: as owner

**Languages**: Understands/Speaks Common + bonus languages, per Int score. Only the Magic User can 	understand the familiar. 
When the familiar is present, it permits the Magic User to speak to animals of its kind and any other languages it knows. On addition, the Familiar adds its Intelligence Bonus to owner’s Learn Spells, Spell Research, and Magic Item Creation checks.

### Slime Splitting
Assume that slimes are roughly spherical, and their hit dice are proportional to their volume, but their damage output is proportional to their surface area. Assume that the splitting stops at 1 HD. 

||Ochre Jelly|Black Pudding|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**Start**|5HD, 1d6 damage|10HD, 3d6 damage|
|**1st Split**|2HD, 1d4 damage|5 HD, 2d6 damage|
|**2nd Split**|1 HD, 1d3 damage|2HD, 1d6+2 damage|
|**3rd Split**|N/A|1 HD, 1d6 damage|




## Grievous Wounds

When a character reaches or goes below 0 hit points, the character has suffered a grievous wound and must roll on the tables below. Once for location, and again for severity.

## Tournaments and Contests

### Archery

Each participant gets to take 6 shots at a dish sized target 30 feet
away backed by an earthen "butt". The target itself is AC 10, and some
targets will have inner rings of AC 5 and AC 0. Each hit on the target
scores 1 point. Inner rings are worth 2 or 3 points respectively. A
critical failure misses the butt entirely and may result in penalties.

In head-to-head competition, participants alternate shots. On a critical
hit, there is a 1 in 6 chance to strike and split the opponent's arrow.

### Jousting (Simplified)

In a proper tournament joust, riders must wear plate armor and shield
with no enchantments. They make use of blunted lances (no double damage
from a charging mount). Participants take rides until one is unhorsed,
or breaks three lances.

Each ride, the participants roll their standard melee attack. On a hit,
the target must save vs stone. If the save is successful, the attacker's
lance breaks. If the save fails, the target is unhorsed. If the save is
a critical failure, the target also takes lance damage.

### Melee Rumble

Up to 50 participants per side line up across a field in equal armor,
blunt clubs, and no enchantments. Melee proceeds as normal, but the
damage is non-lethal (0 HP only results in a Knock out). The event ends
when one side is entirely down or surrenders. This can also be resolved
quickly using Book of War.

#### Unarmed Attacks

When striking without a weapon (including strikes with just a
gauntlet/brass knuckles), the character suffers a -4 to hit and deals 1
(+Str *Bonus*) points of damage. An unarmored Fighter or Thief can punch
twice per round against a single target.
