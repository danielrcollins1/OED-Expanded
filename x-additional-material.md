# Appendix A: Additional Material

The below additions are not offically part of OED but may be useful to Judges.

## Spell Duration Limits

While it's traditional to have some spells without durations (or listed as permanent or "until dispelled"), 
for world-building purposes we usually interpret all spells as having some limited duration.
In general, we assume the following maximum durations for any level of spell:

|Level|Max Duration|
|:---:|:-----------|
|1    |One day     |
|2    |One week    |
|3    |One month   |
|4    |One year    |
|5    |One decade  |
|6    |One century |

Of course, for the highest-level spells, PCs will likely not be aware of 
any distinction between these limits and actual permanent effects.
As noted elsewhere, the DM should presume some secret variation in scale with these limits (say, 1d20%),
so characters can't ever anticipate the exact moment when they terminate.

## Arcana Obscura

Below is a summary of Cleric, Druid, and Magic User spells not included
in [OED Book of Spells](http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/original-edition-delta-book-of-spells-2nd-edition/15995854).
They can be used for Judges who wish to include other kinds of spell-casters, or diversify their villains; spellbooks.

For even more spells, a Judge can reference the 
[Wizard's Spell Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17468/Wizards-Spell-Compendium-Vol-1-2e),
using the above spells as a guideline for streamlining the entry.

## Class Abilities

### Unarmed Attacks

When striking without a weapon (including strikes with just a gauntlet/brass knuckles), the character suffers a -4 to hit and deals 1 point of damage, plus half the Strength bonus, as a subdual attack (Target unconcious at 0HP, crits = lethal damage).

### Fighter Feats

**Beast-master**: Gain a +4 to reaction/morale checks with animals and may treat one animal at a time, of a lower Hit Die, as a Hireling. It does not take a share of treasure, but you do need to pay upkeep costs.  It takes a share of XP and gains levels as a Fighter. 

**Blind Fight**: You avoid penalties in melee combat against unseen opponents (invisibility, darkness, etc.). Note this does not affect ranged attacks or allow spotting at a distance.

**Pugilist**: You do not suffer a -4 to hit when making unarmed attacks, which now do 1d4 base damage, plus your full Strength bonus. On an attack roll of 20, opponents must Save vs Death or be stunned (unable to move/act) for 1 round.

## Clerics

If thou must...

**Armor**: Light (Leather), Medium (Chain), Heavy (Plate), Shields

**Turn Undead**: A Cleric may brandish their Holy Symbol in order repel the Undead. When doing so, the player rolls 1d6 + (Cleric Level -5), with the result being the highest Hit Die of Undead affected. Up to 2d6 such creatures are affected (lowest Hit Die first). If the Cleric's level exceeds the Undead's Hit Dice by 4 or more, the Undead is reduced to 0 HP instead. Such an ability works to a range of 60', once per day
per given creature(s).

An Example Notation for a 10th level Cleric: "Turn Undead: HD = d6+5; 2d6 creatures, destroy 6HD or below."

**Spell Casting**: Standard "Vancian" magic; Only 1 instance of a spell can be prepared at a time (no duplicates). To cast a spell a Cleric must brandish their holy symbol with a free hand.

**Spells known**: Clerics start play with knowledge of all the standard Cleric spells in Vol 1.

**Learning Spells**: Should the Cleric encounter a new spell, it will require a roll of d20 + Cleric Level + Wis modifier ≥ 20. Requires 1 day per spell level (3 tries per spell)

**Magic Item Creation**: Takes 1 day and 100 sp per spell level/charge/use and the ability to cast the relevant spell(s). The Judge will secretly roll a 1 in 20 chance for a mishap/cursed item.

## Creatures

### Familiars

A Familiar is a spirit that takes on the form of a small animal to provide magical knowledge to a mortal. In practice, they function as a special sort of “hireling” for magic users. Statistics are the same as the animal form except:

**Alignment**: d6; 1 (Lawful), 2-3 (Neutral), 4-6 (Chaotic).

**Intelligence**: d6+12.

**Saves**: As owner.

**Languages**: Understands/Speaks Owner's racial language and gains bonus languages per Intelligence bonus. Only the Magic User can understand the familiar. When the familiar is present, it permits the Magic User to speak to animals of its kind and any other languages it knows. In addition, the Familiar adds its Intelligence bonus to owner’s Learn Spells, Spell Research, and Magic Item Creation checks.

### Slime Splitting

Assume that slimes are roughly spherical, and their hit dice are proportional to their volume, but their damage output is proportional to their surface area. Assume that the splitting stops at 1 HD. 

|             |Ochre Jelly      |Black Pudding    |
|:------------|:----------------|:----------------|
|**Start**    |5HD, 1d6 damage  |10HD, 3d6 damage |
|**1st Split**|2HD, 1d4 damage  |5 HD, 2d6 damage |
|**2nd Split**|1 HD, 1d3 damage |2HD, 1d6+2 damage|
|**3rd Split**|N/A              |1 HD, 1d6 damage |

## Equipment Options

### Non-Proficiency

**Using prohibited Armor**: Double encumbrance, halve bonus, negate any Thief or Wizard abilities.

**Using prohibited Weapons**: -4 to hit and reduce damage die by 1 step.

### Helmets

Alternative rule for helmets, in case the save vs. criticals is undesirable:

**Helmets**: For each armor type, the listed AC assumes the use of a helmet.  If a helmet is not worn, then a 1 point penalty to AC is applied.

### Upkeep Costs ###
Should calculating and tracking 1% of XP prove troublesome, you can instead opt to charge at level up, as a form of deferred upkeep.  This charge is equal to 5% of the XP needed for the level, in Silver.  Ex: 100 SP to become a 2nd level Fighter, 480 SP to become an 5th level Thief, 5,000 SP to become a 9th level Wizard, etc.

## Grievous Wounds

When a character reaches or goes below 0 hit points, the character has suffered a grievous wound and must roll on the tables below. Once for location, and again for severity.

|**d%**|**Location**          | Severity Row|

## Language and Literacy

The original game presumes a binary approach to languages. The below is intended to add some granularity to how languages are handled while still fitting into the base rules.

Familiarity with a spoken language is broken into three levels.

**Basic**: You know words for basic concepts (food, shelter, surrender, help, etc.).

**Proficient**: You can easily carry on a conversation in this language, albeit with an accent.

**Fluent**: You can pass as a native speaker
- Every creature is Fluent in their native language and Proficient in their other starting languages.
- When a creature is literate in a language, it is at the same level of familiarity as their speaking ability.
- All Characters are presumed to be literate in their starting languages. It is left to the Judge to decide the literacy and languages of creatures types in general.

In place of the standard 1 extra “language” per point of Intelligence above 10, grant 2 “language points” which can be spent on basic familiarity with a new language and/or improve a known language one step. 

Should a creature find themselves immersed in a new language (and have no spare language slots/points) they can pick up the language for “free” with the following considerations. 

- They can only have 1 such language at a time.
- It takes a week to gain Basic familiarity, a Month for Literacy, and a Season for Proficiency.
- You can never become a Fluent speaker in this manner.
- You will lose this language if you leave immersion for a Season or more (the Judge may allow you to “pick it up” again at an accelerated rate).

## Sleep

- Sleeping creatures suffer a -4 penalty to surprise and detection rolls.
  
**Sleep Deprivation**
- Characters who do not get sufficient rest (typically 6 to 8 hours in a 24 hour period) do not gain the benefits of natural healing.
- Creatures suffer a cumulative -2 to rolls and checks for every rest period they miss. This penalty is recovered by 1 for every regained period of rest.
- If needed, the Judge can enforce a Save vs Death, including the penalties above, to determine if a creature can stay awake on its own.

## Tournaments and Contests

### Archery

Each participant gets to take 6 shots at a dish sized target 30 feet away backed by an earthen "butt". The target itself is AC 10, and some targets will have inner rings of AC 5 and AC 0. Each hit on the target scores 1 point. Inner rings are worth 2 or 3 points respectively. A critical failure misses the butt entirely.

In head-to-head competition, participants alternate shots. On a critical hit, there is a 1 in 6 chance to strike and split the opponent's arrow.

### Jousting

In a proper tournament joust, riders must wear plate armor and shield with no enchantments. They make use of blunted lances (subdual damage).

Each ride, the participants roll their standard melee attack. On a hit, the target must save vs stone. If the save is successful, the attacker's lance breaks. If the save fails, the target is unhorsed. 
Participants take rides until one is unhorsed.

### Melee

Up to 50 participants per side line up across a field in equal armor, no enchantments, and blunt clubs (subdual damage). Melee proceeds as normal; the event ends when one side is entirely down or surrenders. 
This can also be resolved quickly using Book of War.


## War Machine, Book of

The War Machine is a system of game rules designed to resolve large battles released in the Rules Cyclopedia. As an alternative to the complex calculations presented in those rules, one can use the point cost values of units as presented in OED Book of War as the Battle Rating. 

To determine the outcome of the engagement, each side of engagement rolls a d% and adds this to their Battle Rating. The force with the highest result wins.

For a list of conditions that can modify Battle Rating (ratio of troops numbers, environmental and terrain factors, etc.) see chapter 9 of the _Rules Cyclopedia_.
