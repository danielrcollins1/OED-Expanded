**Turn Undead**: A Cleric may brandish their Holy Symbol in order repel the Undead. When doing so, the player rolls 1d6 + (Cleric Level -5), with the result being the highest Hit Die of Undead affected. Up to 2d6 such creatures are affected (lowest Hit Die first). If the Cleric's level exceeds the Undead's Hit Dice by 4 or more, the Undead is reduced to 0 HP instead. Such an ability works to a range of 60', once per day
per given creature(s).

An Example Notation for a Cleric 10: "Turn Undead: HD = d6+5; 2d6 creatures, destroy 6HD or below."

**Spell Casting**: Standard "Vancian" magic; Only 1 instance of a spell can be prepared at a time (no duplicates). To cast a spell a Cleric must brandish their holy symbol with a free hand.

**Spells known**: Clerics start with knowledge of all the standard Cleric spells in Vol 1.

**Learning Spells**: Should the Cleric encounter a new spell, it will require a roll of d20 + Cleric Level + Wis modifier ≥ 20. Requires 1 day per spell level (3 tries per spell)

**Magic Item Creation**: Takes 1 day and 100 sp per spell level/charge/use and the ability to cast the relevant spell(s). The Judge will secretly roll a 1 in 20 chance for a mishap/cursed item.

## Creatures

### Familiars

A Familiar is a spirit that takes on the form of a small animal to provide magical knowledge to a mortal. In practice, they function as a special sort of “hireling” for magic users. Statistics are the same as the animal form except:

**Alignment**: d6; 1 (Lawful), 2-3 (Neutral), 4-6 (Chaotic).

**Intelligence**: d6+12.

**Saves**: As owner.

**Languages**: Understands/Speaks Owner's racial language + bonus languages, per Int score. Only the Magic User can understand the familiar. When the familiar is present, it permits the Magic User to speak to animals of its kind and any other languages it knows. On addition, the Familiar adds its Intelligence Bonus to owner’s Learn Spells, Spell Research, and Magic Item Creation checks.

### Slime Splitting

Assume that slimes are roughly spherical, and their hit dice are proportional to their volume, but their damage output is proportional to their surface area. Assume that the splitting stops at 1 HD. 

||Ochre Jelly|Black Pudding|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**Start**|5HD, 1d6 damage|10HD, 3d6 damage|
|**1st Split**|2HD, 1d4 damage|5 HD, 2d6 damage|
|**2nd Split**|1 HD, 1d3 damage|2HD, 1d6+2 damage|
|**3rd Split**|N/A|1 HD, 1d6 damage|

## Equipment Options

### Non-Proficiency

**Using prohibited Armor**: Double encumbrance, halve bonus, negate any Thief or Wizard abilities.

**Using prohibited Weapons**: -4 to hit and reduce damage die by 1 step.

### Helmets

Alternative rule for helmets, in case the save vs. criticals is undesirable:

**Helmets**: For each armor type, the listed AC assumes the use of a helmet.  If a helmet is not worn, then a 1 point penalty to AC is applied.

### Upkeep Costs ###
Should calculating and tracking 1% of XP prove troublesome, you can instead opt charge at level up, as a form of deferred upkeep.  This charge is equal to 5% of the XP needed for the level, in Silver.  Ex: 100 SP to become a 2nd level Fighter,  480 SP to become an 5th level Thief, 5,000 SP to become a 9th level Wizard, etc.

## Grievous Wounds

When a character reaches or goes below 0 hit points, the character has suffered a grievous wound and must roll on the tables below. Once for location, and again for severity.

|**d%**|**Location**          | Severity Row|

## Language and Literacy

The original game presumes a binary approach to languages. The below is intended to add some granularity to how languages are handled while still fitting into the base rules.

Familiarity with a spoken language is broken into three levels.

**Basic**: You know words for basic concepts (food, shelter, surrender, help, etc.).

**Proficient**: You can easily carry on a conversation in this language, albeit with an accent.

**Fluent**: You can pass as a native speaker
- Every creature is Fluent in their native language and Proficient in their other starting languages.
- When a creature is literate in a language, it is at the same level of familiarity as their speaking ability.
- All Characters are presumed to be literate in their starting languages. It is left to the Judge to decide the literacy and languages of creatures types in general.

In place of the standard 1 extra “language” per point of Intelligence above 10, grant 2 “language points” which can be spent on basic familiarity with a new language and/or improve a known language one step. 

Should a creature find themselves immersed in a new language (and have no spare language slots/points) they can pick up the language for “free” with the following considerations. 

- They can only have 1 such language at a time.
- It takes a week to gain Basic familiarity, a Month for Literacy, and a Season for Proficiency.
- You can never become a Fluent speaker in this manner.
- You will lose this language if you leave immersion for a Season or more (the Judge may allow you to “pick it up” again at an accelerated rate).

## Tournaments and Contests

### Archery

Each participant gets to take 6 shots at a dish sized target 30 feet
away backed by an earthen "butt". The target itself is AC 10, and some
targets will have inner rings of AC 5 and AC 0. Each hit on the target
scores 1 point. Inner rings are worth 2 or 3 points respectively. A
critical failure misses the butt entirely.

In head-to-head competition, participants alternate shots. On a critical
hit, there is a 1 in 6 chance to strike and split the opponent's arrow.

### Jousting

In a proper tournament joust, riders must wear plate armor and shield
with no enchantments. They make use of blunted lances (subdual damage).

Each ride, the participants roll their standard melee attack. On a hit,
the target must save vs stone. If the save is successful, the attacker's
lance breaks. If the save fails, the target is unhorsed. 
Participants take rides until one is unhorsed.

### Melee

Up to 50 participants per side line up across a field in equal armor, 
no enchantments, and blunt clubs (subdual damage). Melee proceeds as normal;
the event ends when one side is entirely down or surrenders. 
This can also be resolved quickly using Book of War.


## War Machine, Book of

The War Machine is a system of game rules designed to resolve large battles released in the Rules Cyclopedia. As an alternative to the complex calculations presented in those rules, one can use the point cost values of units as presented in OED Book of War as the Battle Rating. 

To determine the outcome of the engagement, each side of engagement rolls a d% and adds this to their Battle Rating. The force with the highest result wins.

For a list of conditions that can modify Battle Rating (ratio of troops numbers, environmental and terrain factors, etc.) see chapter 9 of the _Rules Cyclopedia_.
