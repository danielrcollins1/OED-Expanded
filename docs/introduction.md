# Introduction

## What is OED?

OED is a short set of house rules for Original D&D (1974 edition).

Many of us find the original game the purest, most playable, most DM-friendly version, but it does have some gaps and confusing points. OED clarifies and streamlines various topics to make these rules more approachable to the modern gamer.

## What are the main modifications?

-   All combat actions are rolled d20 + level + modifiers, with success on 20 or more (no tables!).
-   Wizards can't memorize duplicate spells (more variety!).
-   Clerics are removed (scarier undead and injuries!).
-   Money is silver standard (more value for PC gold!).
-   Encumbrance is historical stone unites (easier numbers!).
-   Melee weapons each get a simple, unique benefit.
-   All the monsters and magic work like core D&D.

## Where can I get it?
