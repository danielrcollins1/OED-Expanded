== Equipment

=== Money

*Starting Money*: 3d6x10 Silver Pieces (SP).

*Silver Standard*: OED uses a Silver standard for money.
A Silver Piece in OED has the buying power of a GP in traditional sources.
In published sources replace references to "gold pieces" with "silver pieces", keeping original amount.
Silver becomes Copper, Platinum becomes Gold and so on.

*Calculating Costs*: For items not listed, take the historical value in shillings and multiply by 3 for SP cost.

*Monthly Upkeep*: Equal to 1% of current XP (of highest class) in Silver Pieces, minimum 20sp.
Paid monthly.
If unpaid, the character suffers -10% to Attack rolls and HP, cumulative per month.

=== Encumbrance

OED measures the encumbrance value of items in "stone", roughly equivalent to the historical unit.
Characters can carry a number of stone equal to their Strength.
A character's encumbrance affects their movement rate as shown below.
This encumbrance level also functions as a modifier to some rolls.

|up to 1/3 Strength
