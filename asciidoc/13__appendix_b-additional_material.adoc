For even more spells, a GM can reference the https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17468/Wizards-Spell-Compendium-Vol-1-2e[Wizard's Spell Compendium], using the above spells as a guideline for streamlining the entry.

=== Castle Construction

When the time comes for a PC or party to establish their own stronghold, they can construct a basic keep that is able to control 1 hex worth of territory for a cost of 80,000 silver.
Such a Keep requires 282 weeks (5.4 years) to build.
They can quadruple the price to reduce the build time by the same factor.

For basic gameplay, the Judge can presume that such a Keep can sustain itself so far as staff, and basic soldiers under most circumstances.
If the PCs wish to explore the hiring of specialists or other economic actives, there is a list of specialists, siege weaponry, etc. in Volume III. (and perhaps a future expansion to this document)

If other sorts of construction are desired, one can take the square root of the price found in Vol III (or the historical price in shillings x3) as the number of weeks to build.
Each multiplied cost factor divides time by a like amount, up to quadruple cost/speed.

=== Tournaments and Contests

==== Archery

Each participant gets to take 6 shots at a dish sized target 30 feet away backed by an earthen "butt".
The target itself is AC 10, and some targets will have inner rings of AC 5 and AC 0. Each hit on the target scores 1 point.
Inner rings are worth 2 or 3 points respectively.
A critical failure misses the butt entirely and may result in penalties.

In head-to-head competition, participants alternate shots.
On a critical hit, there is a 1 in 6 chance to strike and split the opponent's arrow.

==== Jousting (Simplified)

In a proper tournament joust, riders must wear plate armor and shield with no enchantments.
They make use of blunted lances (no double damage from a charging mount).
Participants take rides until one is unhorsed, or breaks three lances.

Each ride, the participants roll their standard melee attack.
On a hit, the target must save vs stone.
If the save is successful, the attacker's lance breaks.
If the save fails, the target is unhorsed.
If the save is a critical failure, the target also takes lance damage.

==== Melee Rumble

Up to 50 participants per side line up across a field in equal armor, blunt clubs, and no enchantments.
Melee proceeds as normal, but the damage is non-lethal (0 HP only results in a Knock out).
The event ends when one side is entirely down or surrenders.
This can also be resolved quickly using Book of War.

=== Unarmed Attacks

When striking without a weapon (including strikes with just a gauntlet/brass knuckles), the character suffers a -4 to hit and deals 1 (+Str [.underline]#Bonus#) points of damage.
An unarmored Fighter or Thief can punch twice per round against a single target.
