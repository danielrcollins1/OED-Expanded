== Traps

When stocking a dungeon, there is a 1 in 6 chance for a room to have a trap.
Searching has a base 2 in 6 chance to spot a trap, and there is a base 2 in 6 chance (per creature) to trigger a trap.
The judge may rule that a trap resets in 1d6 turns When a trap is indicated, roll a d6 and consult the result against the level of the dungeon (depth) in question.
This will give you the "Threat" rank (I – VI) of the trap.
Finally, roll a d12 and match the result to the given Threat rank.

=== Trap Descriptions

Optionally, convert any pit to a chute to a lower level.
