|===

*Spell Casting*: Standard "Vancian" magic; Only 1 instance of a spell can be memorized at a time. +
*Spellbook*: Wizards start with a spellbook containing all 1st level spells.
Each level of spells requires its own book.
Replacement or duplicate spellbooks require time and expense the same as learning spells. +
*Learning Spells*: Adding a new spell from a book or scroll requires a roll of d20 + Wizard Level + Int modifier ≥ 20. Requires 1 day per spell level (3 tries per spell) +
*Spell Research*: Requires 1 week per spell level and a roll of d20 + Wizard Level + Int Modifier ≥ 20. Access to a library or other resources grant a +4 to the roll +
*Magic Item Creation*: Takes 1 day and 100SP per spell level/charge/use and the ability to cast the relevant spell(s).

NOTE: Treat potions of healing as a 1st level spell, and Mithridate as 4th level spell.
The DM will secretly roll a 1 in 20 chance for a mishap/cursed item.

=== Multi Classing

*Adding Classes*: A character must have a 16 or greater in the Prime Requisite of the new class (Strength for Fighter, Dexterity for Thieves, Intelligence for Wizards), and must pay 1000xp to add the new class.

NOTE: Elves begin play as a member of the Wizard class and one other without needing to meet the above requirements.

*Experience Points*: After each adventure, the character applies all earned XP to a single class of their choice.

*Benefits of Multiclassing*:

* Uses the best entry for Armor.
* Uses the best entry for Weapons.
* Uses the best value for Attacks
* Uses the highest class for Saves
* Keep a separate HP tally for each class and use the higher of the two for your character's HP.
* Fighter/Wizards may cast spells in Light (Leather) and Medium (Chain) armor as long as they do not employ a shield.
* Fighter/Wizards may cast spells so long as they only wield 1 handed melee weapon, and have a free hand.
* Thief skills can only be used in Light (Leather) armor.

=== Alignment

OED features 3 alignment options:

* [.underline]#Lawful# beings want civilization peaceful and expanding; they take prisoners, pay taxes, obey the king.
* [.underline]#Neutral# beings seek a balance, or are simply disinterested.
* [.underline]#Chaotic# beings want civilization broken down and destroyed; they never take prisoners and stab each other in the back.

PCs should list their alignment as either neutral or lawful and secretly inform the DM.
