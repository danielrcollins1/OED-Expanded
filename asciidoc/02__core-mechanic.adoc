== Core Mechanic

Original Edition Delta uses Target 20 for combat and resolution with the same results as D&D, but no tables or new statistics required.

=== What Is Target 20?

Target 20 is an easy and elegant way to adjudicate combat in classic D&D – without any tables or new statistics, using just the original rules.
Here's the basic idea: *Every roll is d20 + level + modifiers, with a result of 20 or more indicating success.*

Easy, right?
Many DMs have been using this to simplify their games for years now.
The mechanic is purely additive, which most people find easier than an inverse-subtraction method (e.g., THACO).
The target is always 20, and AC is just another added modifier – there's no need to invent a new target score for every opponent or skill check (e.g., as in the d20 System).
Here's some more detail:

=== Attack Rolls

Attacks are resolved by rolling *d20 + fighter level + modifiers + target AC* (success on 20 or more).
For actual fighters and monsters, the base addition is just their level or hit dice (for other classes, we take a ratio: 2/3 level for clerics and thieves; 1/2 level for wizards).
Players may wish to document their total attack adjustments; but the DM doesn't need any new stats, because they just add the HD value for any attacking monsters.
When PCs attack a monster, we usually keep the AC secret and add it mentally after the player announces their roll; note that using the classic descending AC means that the better the armor, the less an attacker gets to add.

=== Saving Throws

Saving throws work likewise: *roll d20 + character level + modifiers* (success on 20 or more).
The modifiers in this case are by type of save: +0 vs. spells, +1 vs. breath, +2 vs. stone, +3 vs. wands, +4 vs. death.
With this simplification, we don't even bother to record saving scores on PC sheets anymore.

=== Thief Skills

Thief skills get the same treatment: *roll d20 + thief level + modifiers* (success on 20 or more).
We grant the thief's Dexterity modifier as a bonus to this roll.
We don't even bother writing down separate skill categories with this streamlining.

=== How Accurate Is It?

In 2018, we learned that the http://playingattheworld.blogspot.com/2018/09/why-did-armor-class-descend-from-9-to-2.html[pre-publication draft] of the original D&D rules used no combat tables, and was instead based on a simple formula equivalent to the one we have here.
You'll see a link from that site back to our blog, where we deduced this fact a decade or more prior.
Compared to the table versions that we do see in the official books, Target 20 tends to produce results, on average, within 1 or 2 pips (regardless of which classic edition you use).
For example, with attacks, the results are identical to Original D&D at 1st level, and grow a bit more generous with advancing levels.
Likewise, for thief skills (assuming a 1 or 2 point Dexterity bonus), results are identical to OD&D at 1st level, and then fall slightly behind at higher levels.
