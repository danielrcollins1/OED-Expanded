== Monsters

OED uses the monsters presented in Vol II with the adjustments below.

=== Monster Information

*Hit Dice*: All monsters use a d6 for their base Hit Dice, which is used to calculate combat abilities.

*Equivalent Hit Dice*: Monsters in OED have an Equivalent Hit Dice value that takes into account their special abilities and relative power.
This is used to determine monster encounters and XP rewards.

*Attacks*: Monster attacks are resolved by d20 + Hit Die + Target AC ≥ 20. Monsters get a single attack per round unless otherwise noted.

*Monster Damage*: Monster damage is determined on a 1d6, unless otherwise noted.

*Monster Strength*: If necessary, you can assume a Monster's Strength modifier is equal to ½ its Hit Die.

*Magic to Hit*: For every 4 natural Hit Die a creature possesses, it is capable of harming creatures that normally require +1 magic weapon to hit.

*Languages*: It is assumed than an intelligent creature has a base 1 in 6 chance to speak common.

*Gaze Attacks*: Creatures facing beings with Gaze Attacks must make a Save each round unless precautions are taken.

*Chimera/Gorgons*: Each round roll a 2d6, a result of 7+ means the creature will use its breath weapon.
It can use its breath weapon a total of 3 times per day.

*Dragons*: Divide the Dragon's HP by 3 to determine its Hit Dice.
Use this Hit Dice value to determine Attacks and Saves.
Each round roll a 2d6, a result of 7+ means the creature will use its breath weapon.
It can use its breath weapon a total of 3 times per day.
A Dragon's breath weapon does 1 die of damage for every 6 hit points it currently possesses.
Dragons can force a morale check on NPCs within 75 feet.
They have a 2 in 6 chance to detect creatures within 75 feet.
Dragon subdual rules are not used.

*Goblin-kin*: Goblins, Orcs, and Kobolds suffer a -4 to attack, and -1 to Morale in full daylight.

*Giants*: Giants can throw a stone every other round at ranges of of 100' to 140'.
Giant melee attacks are 1d10 +Str bonus.
Giant garb is equivalent to Leather armor on top of naturally tough skin (+3 AC).

*Horses*: Non-Warhorses are unusable in combat, near to fire or smells, etc. (auto-fail morale)

*Slimes*: Successful attacks by these creatures will cause metal to corrode instantly.
Metal weapons used against them will corrode on a successful attack.
Wood is consumed at too slow a rate to affect combat.

*Undead*: Undead are (mostly) immune to backstabs, critical hits, death effects, and mental attacks.

*Skeletons*: Skeletons are 1 Hit Die monsters

*Vampires*: Vampires can summon 1d10 Rats (AC 7, Mv 75', HD 1/6 (1HP), Att +0, Dmg 1) or 3d6 Wolves (AC 7, Mv 90', HD 2+2, Att +1, Dmg 1d6)

*Zombies*: Zombies are 2 Hit Die monsters

=== Monster Placement

Within the dungeon, there is a 2 in 6 chance a monster is present in any unallocated space (See Monster Determination below)

==== Wandering Monsters

*Checks*: Make a 1 in 6 check for wandering monsters using the below guidelines:

* Every 15 minutes of real time play.
* During long searches, such as those for secret doors, etc.
* On the parties exit from dungeon.
* In the presence of loud/combat noise.

If a wandering monster result is indicated, use the Monster Determination information below.
Multiple parties of monsters may attack one another.
On a near miss (result of 5), give a hint that monsters are present (ex: distant monster noise).

=== Monster Determination

To determine the type of monster encountered, roll a d6 and consult the result against the level of the dungeon (depth) in question.
This will give you the "Threat" rank (I – VI) of the monster.

==== Number Appearing

When stocking a dungeon, the numbers of monsters appearing dependent on the relation between the Equivalent Hit Die of the creature and dungeon level (presuming a traditional party of 4).

[stripes=even]
|===
|EHD vs Dungeon Level |No. of monsters appearing

|Dungeon is greater by 3 or more
|(1d4+1)*3 (11)

|Dungeon is greater by 1 or 2
|(1d4+1)*2 (7)

|Equal
|1d4+1 (4)

|EHD is greater by 1 or 2
|(1d4+1)/2 (2)

|EHD is greater by 3 or more
|(1d4+1)/3 (1)
|===

For a wandering monster encounter, cut the above number in half.

For a more detailed breakdown of this formula and approach, see: https://deltasdnd.blogspot.com/2018/05/underworld-overhaul-pt-4-monster.html[Underworld Overhaul, Pt. 4: Monster Numbers Appearing]

=== Monster Equivalent Hit Dice

This is a measure of monster threat that can be slotted into monster determination for a more accurate distribution of challenges.
An * indicates The EHD for this creature is highly situational.
