# Equipment

## Money

**Starting Money**: 3d6x10 **Silver** Pieces (SP).

**Silver Standard**: OED uses a Silver standard for money. A Silver
Piece in OED has the buying power of a GP in traditional sources. In
published sources replace references to "gold pieces' with"silver
pieces", keeping original amount. Silver becomes Copper, Platinum
becomes Gold and so on.  *Note: Men-at-arms costs in gold from the original sources are accurate; do not convert these to silver.*

**Calculating Costs**: For items not listed, take the historical value
in shillings and multiply by 3 for SP cost.

**Monthly Upkeep**: Equal to 1% of current XP (of highest class) in
Silver Pieces, minimum 20 sp. Paid monthly. If unpaid, the character
suffers a penatly of –10% to Attack rolls and HP, cumulative per month.

## Encumbrance

OED measures the encumbrance value of items in "Stone", roughly
equivalent to the historical unit (14 lbs.). Characters can carry a number of
stone equal to their Strength. A character's encumbrance affects their
movement rate as shown below. This encumbrance level also functions as a
modifier to some rolls (see Adventuring Tasks).

For items that do not have a Stone value listed, the Judge is encouraged to enforce common sense, such as limiting the PC to total of 20 for any and all such items.
  
|Level|Stone Carried|Effect|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Level 0|Up to 1/3 Strength Score|Full Movement Rate: 12" (60')|
|Level 1|Up to 2/3 Strength Score|Movement Reduced 1/3: 9" (45')|
|Level 2|Up to Strength Score|Movement Reduced 1/2 :6" (30')|
|Level 3|Up to 2x Strength Score|Movement Reduced to 3" (15')|

## Weapons

Weapons in OED fall into 3 categories, Light, Medium, and Heavy.  

Weapons have 5 main properties.

- **Sword**: Can be drawn and used in a single round.
- **Spear**: Can be used to attack from the 2nd rank (+5') reach)
- **Axe**: +2 to hit targets in Medium/Heavy armor, or creatures with a
tough hide (AC 5 or better)
- **Club**: +4 to hit targets in Heavy armor, or creatures with a very
tough hide (AC 3 or better)
- **Ranged/Thrown**: -1 to Hit per 10', See also "Shots at Groups" under Combat.

## Armor

Armor in OED comes in 4 types, Light (Leather), Medium (Chain), Heavy (Plate), and Shields.  Helmets require some level or Armor proficiency to use. Leather and Chain armor takes 1 minute/turn to put on, Plate takes 10 minutes/turns and requires assistance.  It takes 1 round (each) to remove a shield, helm, or backpack. Leather and Chain armor have a 3 in 6 chance per round. Plate requires 3 turns to remove with assistance.

\* **Helmets**: A helmet gives a 50% chance (3-in-6) to neutralize a critical hit, turning it into a normal hit instead.
