# Core Mechanic

Original Edition Delta uses Target 20 for combat and resolution with the
same results as D&D, but no tables or new statistics are required.

## What Is Target 20?

Target 20 is an easy and elegant way to adjudicate combat in classic D&D
-- without any tables or new statistics, using just the original rules.
Here's the basic idea: **Every roll is d20 + level + modifiers, with a
result of 20 or more indicating success.**

Easy, right? Many DMs have been using this to simplify their games for
years now. The mechanic is purely additive, which most people find
easier than an inverse-subtraction method (e.g., THACO). The target is
always 20, and AC is just another added modifier -- there's no need to
invent a new target score for every opponent or skill check (e.g., as in
the d20 System). Here's some more detail:

## Attack Rolls

Attacks are resolved by rolling **d20 + fighter level + modifiers +
target AC** (success on 20 or more). For actual fighters and monsters,
the base addition is just their level or hit dice (for other classes, we
take a ratio: 2/3 level for thieves *and clerics*; 1/2 level for wizards).
Players may wish to document their total attack adjustments; but the DM
doesn't need any new stats, because they just add the HD value for any
attacking monsters. When PCs attack a monster, we usually keep the AC
secret and add it mentally after the player announces their roll; note
that using the classic descending AC means that the better the armor,
the less an attacker gets to add.

## Saving Throws

Saving throws work likewise: **roll d20 + character level + modifiers**
(success on 20 or more). The modifiers in this case are by type of save:
+0 vs. spells, +1 vs. breath, +2 vs. stone, +3 vs. wands, +4 vs. death.
With this simplification, we don't even bother to record saving scores
on PC sheets anymore.

## Thief Skills

Thief skills get the same treatment: **roll d20 + thief level +
modifiers** (success on 20 or more). We grant the thief's Dexterity
modifier as a bonus to this roll. We don't even bother writing down
separate skill categories with this streamlining.

## How Accurate Is It?

In 2018 we learned that the [pre-publication
draft](http://playingattheworld.blogspot.com/2018/09/why-did-armor-class-descend-from-9-to-2.html)
of the original D&D rules used no combat tables, and was instead based
on a simple formula equivalent to the one we have here. You\'ll see a
link from that site back to our blog, where we deduced this fact a
decade or more prior. Compared to the table versions that we do see in
the official books, Target 20 tends to produce results, on average,
within 1 or 2 pips (regardless of which classic edition you use). For
example, with attacks, the results are identical to Original D&D at 1st
level, and grow a bit more generous with advancing levels. Likewise, for
thief skills (assuming a 1 or 2 point Dexterity bonus), results are
identical to OD&D at 1st level, and then fall slightly behind at higher
levels. For a more detailed statistical analysis, [please visit our
