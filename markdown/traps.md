# Traps

When stocking a dungeon, there is a 1 in 6 chance for a room to have a
trap.

Searching has a base 2 in 6 chance to spot a trap, and there is a base 2
in 6 chance (per creature) to trigger a trap. The judge may rule that a
trap resets in 1d6 turns

When a trap is indicated, roll a d6 and consult the result against the
level of the dungeon (depth) in question. This will give you the
"Threat" rank (I -- VI) of the trap.

Finally roll a d12 and match the result to the given Threat rank.

## Trap Descriptions

### Pit Traps

The basic pit is 10×10×10\' and hidden by a cover unless a successful
search is made. It generally drops two characters. When triggered,
victims get saves vs. stone or fall in. In a standard depth pit,
resulting in 1d6 points of falling damage (save again for half). The
cover will reset in 1d6 turns unless noted.

A running jump over an open pit may be possible: Assume a jump distance
of d6×3 feet (minus encumbrance level).

For deeper dungeon levels (where the dungeon level is greater than trap
rank), add 10\' to pit depth (+1d6 damage) per level difference.

Optionally, convert any pit to a chute to a lower level.

### Clubbing Traps

Clubbing traps are concealed within the architectural elements of the
structure.

### Crushing Traps

Crushing traps, like clubbing traps, are concealed within the
architectural elements of the structure

**Door, Falling**: This heavy reinforced door springs off of its hinges
landing in 5×10 foot area when the character attempts to open it. It
inflicts 2d6 damage; targets can save vs. stone for half

**Rolling Rock**: A 8' diameter boulder is released down the passage
moving at 9" (45') per round; those struck take 4d6 damage and can save
vs. stone for half. The boulder comes to rest, blocking the passageway,
and can be moved by a party of 4 working in unison.

10\' long area causing 8d6 damage, those affected can save vs. stone for
half.

damage.

**Crushing Wall**: This solid outer section of wall 20\' wide smashes
forward on trigger inflicting 16d6 damage and then retracts. Targets can

### Confining Traps

Confining traps are typically normal appearing rooms that restrict
movement. The Judge should familiarize themselves with the rules for
Forcing Doors, Swimming, etc.

**Net**: A net with hooks and bells drops from the ceiling, landing in
10' × 20' area, entangling those beneath, the sound of which triggers a
check for nearby monsters. Those in the net cannot move, suffer a -2
penalty to AC, and can only make melee attacks with swords and spears at
a -2 penalty. Creatures have a 1 in 6 plus Strength bonus chance per
round to escape. Having a dagger in-hand grants a +2 to this role.
Finally, check for nearby monsters when net falls.

**Portcullis**: An iron gate falls behind party and blocks the passage,
the sound of which triggers a check for nearby monsters. The bars may be
forced as locked door (base 2 in 6, with a --2)

**Watery Room**: The floor of the room is flooded with least 10\' deep.

**Spinning Wall**: A section of wall up to 20' in length spins in place,

**Dropping Ceiling**: The entire stone ceiling drops on the room when
triggered inflicting 12d6 damage to the occupants, who can save
vs. death for half). Passage through the room is then blocked.

### Gas Traps

The basic gas trap covers a 20 × 20\' area with a cracking sound and
distinct smell. When triggered characters can make a save vs. stone,
allowing them to immediately flee the affected area. Those in the area
must save vs. breath each round to avoid the effect of the gas. The gas
clears after one hour.

**Gas, Obscuring**: A hazy gas fills the area imposing a --4 to attacks

**Gas, Sickness**: This sulfurous smelling gas causes the victims to
lose 1d6 points of Strength for one hour unless a save vs. breath is
made.

**Gas, Blinding**: This apple scented gas inflicts blindness for one
hour

**Gas, Poison**: This bitter almond scented gas forces the victims to
save vs. death with a +4 bonus

**Gas, Corroding**: This ammonia smelling gas will rust any metal items
in the area. Each item must succeed a save vs. stone or it falls to
pieces. Magic items get +2 bonus for each magic plus or ability.

**Gas, Insanity**: This fruity smelling gas causes the victim to become
permanently insane unless a save vs. breath is successful. Those
affected are equally likely to attack or flee from allies in any given
encounter. A \_remove curse_spell will lift the affliction.

### Energy/Magic Traps

While these traps may make use of magical effects, they are triggered
and detected in the same manner as other traps. Some mechanical
interface activates the magic, which is undetectable until that time.

**Boiling Oil**: Boiling oil dumps into a 10' radius area inflicting 2d6
points of fire damage. The targets can make a save vs. breath for half
damage.

**Fire Vent**: Flames belch out into a 10' radius inflicting 4d6 points
of fire damage. The targets can make a save vs. breath for half damage.

**Acid Vent**: Acid dumps into a 10' radius area inflicting 4d6 points
of fire damage. The targets can make a save vs. breath for half damage.

**Spells**: These traps work as under their spell description at the
lowest level required to cast. Trap-conjured Elementals are 8 HD
(small). For deeper dungeon levels (where the dungeon level is greater
than trap rank), add +2 to the caster level per degree of difference.
