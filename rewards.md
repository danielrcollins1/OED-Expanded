## Treasure

**Silver Standard**: OED uses a Silver standard for money. A Silver
Piece in OED has the buying power of a GP in traditional sources. In
published sources, replace references to "gold pieces' with"silver
pieces", keeping original amount. Silver becomes Copper, Platinum
becomes Gold and so on.

**Calculating Value**: For mundane items, take the historical value in
shillings x3 for SP value.

**Treasure Hordes**: The Judge should place one or two "big hauls" on
the first few levels of the dungeon, such as a magic item or gems &
jewels. These hauls serve as a "call to action" for starting parties.

For any empty rooms in a dungeon, there is a 1 in 6 chance that a
(hidden) treasure is present.

For rooms with monsters, there is a 3 in 6 chance that treasure is
present.

The table below dictates the type of treasure present.

\* There is a 10% chance the coinage is in gold\
\*\* Gems and Jewelry can be generated using the tables in Vol II page
40. Average value for gems is 501 sp each, and for jewelry is 3,410 sp
each.\
\*\*\* Magic items can be generated using the tables in Vol II page 23,
or [Paul's Game Blog: The Magic Table](https://www.paulsgameblog.com/2018/06/28/magic-tables/).

**Wands/Staves**: Wands can hold a maximum of 20 charges and have d10+10
charges when found. Staves can have a maximum of 40 charges and have
d20+20 charges when found.

**Magic Item Saves**: Grant a +2 bonus to saves and rolls to resist harm
for each plus or special ability.

**Intelligent Swords**: When in conflict; d20 + (Character Intelligence
& Charisma) - (Sword Ego & Intelligence) + Wound Modifier ≥ 20. You can
jot down the simplified formula in the Sword stats. *Wound Modifier*:
Full HP = +15, Half or more = +10, Less than Half = +5

## Experience Points

In OED, characters gain Experience Points for the recovery of treasure,
defeat of monsters, and carousing. *Ability Scores (Prime Requisites) do
not modify XP earned*.

**XP for Treasure**: Character's earn 1 Experience Point for each Silver
Piece value of coin, gems, jewelry they return to civilization.

**XP for Monsters**: The base XP for monsters is equal to 100 x
(Equivalent) Hit Dice (see Monsters below)

**XP for Carousing**: When in town, players can spend d6x 100sp to
carouse, gaining an amount of xp equal to the coin spent (this amount
can be adjusted based on the size of the community). They must save vs
poison or suffer a mishap. If they cannot afford the rolled cost, they
also suffer a mishap. Mishaps can include; tavern brawls, jailed, a
tattoo, hangovers, or anything that could jump-start an adventure.
