# Style Guide for OED Expanded

The rationale for most of these items is to have text that looks more natural in the source Markdown, with less special coding present. Some violations of this stuff may be present from the initial automatic conversion from an ODT file; feel free to remove if you find them. 

## General Rules

- Headings should have blank line before & after (see best practices: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#heading-best-practices).
- Tables & lists require a lead-in blank line (or else PDF fails to generate properly).
- Avoid hard line breaks (slash at end of line; prefer blank line or unordered list for closely related elements)
- Use Unicode math symbols (e.g., â‰¥) where possible instead of HTML codes.
- Avoid ordinal superscripts (e.g., 1^st^).
- Have a period at the end of most lines.
- For asterisked notes, place a space after asterisk.
- Avoid double-space after punctuation.
- Avoid italics in hyperlinks.
