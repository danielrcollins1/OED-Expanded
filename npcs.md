# NPCs

It is recommended that the Judge keep a short roster of basic NPC info (names, stats, personality).  The Judge should run the NPC initially and for the next session generate full stats for the player's reference including personality, (public) alignment, morale, equipment, and treasure share.

NPC types can be generated randomly below.

**Ability Scores**: As below based on level.

**Race**: 1-3 (Human), 4 (Halfling), 5 (Dwarf), 6 (Elf)

**Class**: 1-3 (Fighter), 4-5 (Thief), 6 (Wizard -- roll again for Elf)

**Alignment**: 1-2 (Lawful), 3-5 (Neutral), 6 (Chaotic-Hidden)

**Equipment**: By Class or Profession, NPC's bequeath their belongings to their next of kin.

## Zero Level Characters

**Generation**: Normal folk are assumed to be 0 Level. Their Ability Scores are generated via 3d6 in order. They have 1d6 Hit Points. Their attack and saves bonuses are +0. They can make use of up to 3 weapons
(ex: Sling, Sword, Pike). They possess -1,000 xp.

**Advancing to 1st Level**: When earning 1000xp, to arrive at 0xp, the character can enter one of the three basic classes. Entry to a class presumes they have undergone one of the following: An act of
combat for a Fighter, an act of larceny for a Thief, learning the Read Magic spell for a Wizard. Entry into the Fighter class grants +1HP, entry into the Wizard class removes 1 HP.  Characters graduating to 1st level should have 3HP minimum. 

## Higher Level Characters

**Ability Scores**: Roll 3d6 in order, then add points as desired equal to the starting level + 2 (max 18 in any score).

**Hit Points**: High-level characters re-roll results below 3 on any hit dice at the time of generation, then progress normally.

**Equipment**: Can select any mundane bit of gear to carry on person, encumbrance permitting.

**Spellbooks**: Randomly generate a Wizard's spellbook using the table on Supplement 1 page 8, or use the [Wizard Spellbook Generator](http://deltasdnd.blogspot.com/2017/07/saturday-software-wizard-spellbook.html).
Generally, give the maximum number of low level spells, the minimum number of high level spells, and extrapolate in between (See Spells above)

**Magic Items**: For *every* level of the character's highest class; roll a d6 for *each* of the below magic item categories. A result of 1 awards that magic item. Ex. a 6th level character would roll a d6 six times to see if they get a Sword or Wand, then a d6 six more times for Armor or Scroll, and so on.

-   Sword or Wand
-   Armor or Scroll
-   Potion
-   Weapon, Ring, or Misc. (roll 1d3 to determine which it is)

Each additional "hit" for a given item type indicates an additional +1 bonus, dosage, or ability.

## Hirelings

**Posting Advertisements**: Every 100sp spent on posts/agents will attract 1d3 first level recruits within 1d6 days. The maximum number of potential recruits is equal to 1% of the settlements population (approximately 3 such folks in a typical hamlet). Populations will refresh once per season. Calls to far, elf, or dwarf lands will multiply the cost and time.

**Offers and Shares**: The default rate for a Hireling is 100sp plus a "half share" of the treasure (and XP) split. The NPC will accept this offer based on the outcome of a reaction roll (2d6 + Cha Mod â‰¥ 9). The
roll can be modified by the quality of the offer.

### Specialists

Various specialists can be hired, typically for the rate of 10sp per day. These will often be zero level characters (see above) and they will not enter dungeons or hazardous areas.

#### Sage

A sage can Identify the properties of magic items. The process takes one day and will reveal a single property or command word per instance. A sage can also do research on behalf of the party at a cost of 10sp per day, using the guidelines below:

| |Judge knows the answer| Judge needs to invent the answer |  
|--- |---                   |---|
|**General Topic**| d6 hours | d6 days | 
|**Specific Topic**| d6 days | d6 weeks |

#### Alchemist

Alchemists can provide potions of healing and mithridate (neutralize poison) at the listed prices, taking a week to produce one dose. They may also be able to brew other potions if given a sample.

## Reaction/Morale Checks

Hirelings, NPCs, and Monsters will be called on to make reaction/morale checks which are resolved by a roll of 2d6 and compared against the below table.  The Judge may opt to modify the Morale checks further based on the creature's HD or Level.

|2d6 Result|Reaction|Morale|
|:---|:---|:---|
|  2            |May Attack                | Surrender |
 | 3-5          |Hostile Reaction          | Flee |
 | 6-8          |Uncertain, Can Try Again  | Withdraw |
 | 9-11        | Accepts Offer             | Fight On |
|  12 |          Enthusiastic |              Fight to the Death |

### Morale Triggers

In combat, a 1/3 loss of forces will trigger a morale check. Other triggers include: death of the leader, when abandoned, and when ordered into an obvious/immediately deadly situation.

## Rumors

**Procuring Rumors**: Characters can "buy" rumors at character creation or throughout gameplay. The cost is 1d6x10 sp, which represents buying drinks for locals, bribing guards, and buying odds and ends from traveling merchants.

**Generating Rumors**: Rumors can be generated with a series of d6 rolls as shown below.

*Veracity*: 1-2 = True, 3-4 = Mostly True, 5 = Mostly False, 6 = False.

*Topic*: 1-3 = Dungeon Location, 4-5 = Wilderness Location, 6 = Rules
Lore.

-   *Dungeon Location*: Choose a level of the current dungeon.
-   *Wilderness Location*: Choose a location in a neighboring hex (d6), lair, new dungeon, etc.
-   *Rules Lore*: How to cure Mummy Rot, Wandering Monsters in Area, Holy Water is bunk, etc.
