# Monsters

OED uses the monsters presented in Vol II with the adjustments below.

## Monster Information

**Hit Dice**: All monsters use a d6 for their base Hit Dice, which is used to calculate combat abilities.

**Equivalent Hit Dice**: Monsters in OED have an Equivalent Hit Dice value that takes into account their special abilities and relative power. This is used to determine monster encounters and XP rewards.

**Attacks**: Monster attacks are resolved by d20 + Hit Die + Target AC ≥ 20. Monsters get a single attack per round unless otherwise noted.

**Monster Damage**: Monster damage is rolled on a 1d6, unless otherwise noted.

**Monster Strength**: If necessary, you can assume a Monster's Strength modifier is equal to ½ its Hit Die, and their carry capacity in Stone is (HD*2)+10 (Multiply by 2 or 3 for quardrapeds, etc).

**Gaze Attacks**: Creatures facing beings with Gaze Attacks must make a Save each round unless precautions are taken.

**Grab/Grappling**: Roll a melee attack, if succesful, then opposed Grapple (Strength) checks (d6 + 1/2 HD vs d6 + Target Strength Bonus). Failure means the target can act normally, success means the target is immobilized, or pushed up to ten feet. The target must win a Strength check on their turn to break free.

**Languages**: It is assumed than an intelligent creature has a base 1 in 6 chance to speak common.

**Magic to Hit**: For every 4 *natural* Hit Die a creature possesses, it is capable of harming creatures that normally require +1 magic weapon to hit.

**Mental Attacks**: Undead, golems, slimes, plants, and other non-intelligent creatures are generally immune to such effects, unless specifically targeting that type.

**Chimera/Gorgons**: Each round roll a 2d6, a result of 7+ means the creature will use its breath weapon. It can use its breath weapon a total of 3 times per day.

**Dragons**: Divide the Dragon's HP by 3 to determine its Hit Dice. Use this Hit Dice value to determine Attacks and Saves. Each round roll a 2d6, a result of 7+ means the creature will use its breath weapon. It can use its breath weapon a total of 3 times per day. A Dragon's breath weapon does 1 die of damage for every 6 hit points it currently possesses. Dragons can force a morale check on NPCs within 75 feet. They have a 2 in 6 chance to detect creatures within 75 feet. Dragon subdual rules are not used.

**Goblin-kin**: Goblins, Orcs, and Kobolds suffer a -4 to attack, and -1 to Morale in full daylight.

**Giants**: Giants can throw a stone every other round at ranges of 100' to 140'. Giant melee attacks are 1d10 +Str bonus. Giant garb is equivalent to Leather armor on top of naturally tough skin (+3 AC).

**Horses and Mounts**: Only warhorses are usable near combat, fire, smells, etc. (others auto-fail morale).  The normal load value indicates the maximum load carried at full-speed; up to double this amount can be carried at half-speed.  The normal load values are set at 1/3 of the equine's body weight.

**Slimes**: Successful attacks by these creatures will cause metal to corrode instantly. Metal weapons used against them will corrode on a successful attack. Wood is consumed at too slow a rate to affect combat.

**Undead**: Undead are (mostly) immune to backstabs, critical hits, death effects, and mental attacks.

**Skeletons**: Skeletons are 1 Hit Die monsters.

**Vampires**: Vampires can summon 1d10 Rats (AC 7, Mv 75', HD 1/6 (1HP), Att +0, Dmg 1) or 3d6 Wolves (AC 7, Mv 90', HD 2+2, Att +1, Dmg 1d6).

**Zombies**: Zombies are 2 Hit Die monsters.

## Monster Placement

Within the dungeon, there is a 2 in 6 chance a monster is present in any unallocated space (See Monster Determination below).

## Wandering Monsters

**Checks**: Make a 1 in 6 check for wandering monsters using the below guidelines:

-   Every 15 minutes of real time play.
-   During long searches, such as those for secret doors, etc.
-   On the parties exit from dungeon.
-   In the presence of loud/combat noise.

If a wandering monster result is indicated, use the Monster Determination information below. Multiple parties of monsters may attack one another. On a near miss (result of 5), give a hint that monsters are present (ex: distant monster noise).

## Monster Determination

To determine the type of monster encountered, roll a d6 and consult the result against the level of the dungeon (depth) in question. This will give you the "Threat Rank" (I - VI) of the monster, which you can then look up the appropriate (Equivalent) Hit Die range.

|**Dungeon Depth**|**d6 Result**|      |       |      |     |      ||**Threat Rank**|**Monster (Equivalent)<br>Hit Dice**|
|:----------------------|:-----------:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:---:|:----:|---|:---------------|:------------------------------------|
|1                      |1-4          |5     |6      |      |     |      ||**I**          |1 HD                                |
|2                      |1-2          |3-4   |5      |6     |     |      ||**II**         |2 HD                                |
|3-4                    |1            |2     |3-4    |5     |6    |      ||**III**        |3-4 HD                              |
|5-7                    |             |1     |2      |3-4   |5    |6     ||**IV**         |5-7 HD                              |
|8-10                   |             |      |1      |2     |3-4  |5-6   ||**V**          |8-10 HD                             |
|11                     |             |      |       |1     |2    |3-6   ||**VI**         |11+ HD                              |
|**Threat Rank**        |**I**        |**II**|**III**|**IV**|**V**|**VI**||               |                                    |


## Number Appearing

When stocking a dungeon, the numbers of monsters appearing is dependent on the relation between the Equivalent Hit Die of the creature and dungeon level/depth (presuming a traditional party of 4)

|EHD vs Dungeon Level|No of monsters appearing|
|:-------------------|:-----------------------|
|Dungeon level is greater by 3 or more    | (1d4+1) or ~2 3/4 party size |
|Dungeon level is greater by 1 or 2  | (1d4+1) or ~ 1 3/4 party size|
|Dungeon level and EHD are equal     | 1d4+1 or equal to party size |
|EHD is greater by 1 or 2      | (1d4+1) or 1/2 party size    |
|EHD is greater by 3 or more   | (1d4+1) or 1/4 party size    |

For a wandering monster encounter, cut the above number in half.

## Monster Equivalent Hit Dice

This is a measure of monster threat that can be slotted into monster determination formula (in place of the Hit Die) for a more accurate distribution of challenges.
