# Monsters

OED uses the monsters presented in Vol II with the adjustments below.

## Monster Information

**Hit Dice**: All monsters use a d6 for their base Hit Dice, which is used to calculate combat abilities.

**Equivalent Hit Dice**: Monsters in OED have an Equivalent Hit Dice value that takes into account their special abilities and relative power. This is used to determine monster encounters and XP rewards.

**Attacks**: Monster attacks are resolved by d20 + Hit Die + Target AC ≥ 20. Monsters get a single attack per round unless otherwise noted.

**Monster Damage**: Monster damage is rolled on a 1d6, unless otherwise noted.

**Monster Strength**: If necessary, you can assume a Monster's Strength modifier is equal to ½ its Hit Die, and their carry capacity in Stone is (HD*2)+10 (Multiply by 1.5 or 2.5 for quardrapeds, mounts, etc).

**Gaze Attacks**: Creatures facing beings with Gaze Attacks must make a Save each round unless precautions are taken.

**Grab/Grappling**: Roll a melee attack, if succesful, then opposed Grapple (Strength) checks (d6 + 1/2 HD vs d6 + Target Strength Bonus). Failure means the target can act normally, success means the target is immobilized, or pushed up to ten feet. The target must win a Strength check on their turn to break free.

**Languages**: It is assumed than an intelligent creature has a base 1 in 6 chance to speak common.

**Level Drain**: Characters are allowed a Save vs Death to avoid Level Drain effect. If the save is failed, XP is set to the midpoint of the prior level. Current and Max HP are reduced proportionally (divide by original level), possibly resulting in death at 0hp. The number of lost HP should be noted and returned if/when the level is re-achieved.

**Magic to Hit**: For every 4 *natural* Hit Die a creature possesses, it is capable of harming creatures that normally require +1 magic weapon to hit.

**Mental Attacks**: Undead, golems, slimes, plants, and other non-intelligent creatures are generally immune to such effects, unless specifically targeting that type.

**Chimera/Gorgons**: Each round roll a 2d6, a result of 7+ means the creature will use its breath weapon. It can use its breath weapon a total of 3 times per day.

**Dragons**: Divide the Dragon's HP by 3 to determine its Hit Dice. Use this Hit Dice value to determine Attacks and Saves. Each round roll a 2d6, a result of 7+ means the creature will use its breath weapon. It can use its breath weapon a total of 3 times per day. A Dragon's breath weapon does 1 die of damage for every 6 hit points it currently possesses. Dragons can force a morale check on NPCs within 75 feet. They have a 2 in 6 chance to detect creatures within 75 feet. Dragon subdual rules are not used.

**Goblin-kin**: Goblins, Orcs, and Kobolds suffer a -4 to attack, and -1 to Morale in full daylight.

**Giants**: Giants can throw a stone every other round at ranges between 100' to 140'. Giant melee attacks are 1d10 +Str bonus. Giant garb is equivalent to Leather armor on top of naturally tough skin (+3 AC).

**Horses and Mounts**: Only warhorses are usable near combat, fire, smells, etc. (others auto-fail morale).  The light load value indicates the weight that can be carried while travelling at full-speed; up to double this amount can be carried at half-speed.  The normal load values are set at 1/3 of the equine's body weight.

**Slimes**: Successful attacks by these creatures will cause metal to corrode instantly. Metal weapons used against them will corrode on a successful attack. Wood is consumed at too slow a rate to affect combat.

**Undead**: Undead are (mostly) immune to backstabs, critical hits, death effects, and mental attacks.

**Skeletons**: Skeletons are 1 Hit Die monsters.

**Vampires**: Vampires can summon 1d10 Rats (AC 7, Mv 75', HD 1/6 (1HP), Att +0, Dmg 1) or 3d6 Wolves (AC 7, Mv 90', HD 2+2, Att +1, Dmg 1d6).

**Zombies**: Zombies are 2 Hit Die monsters.

## Monster Placement

Within the dungeon, there is a 2 in 6 chance a monster is present in any unallocated space (See Monster Determination below).

## Wandering Monsters

**Checks**: Make a 1 in 6 check for wandering monsters using the below guidelines:

-   Every 15 minutes of real time play.
-   During long searches, such as those for secret doors, etc.
-   On the parties exit from dungeon at the end of the session.
-   In the presence of loud/combat noise.

If a wandering monster result is indicated, use the Monster Determination information below. Multiple parties of monsters may attack one another. On a near miss (result of 5), give a hint that monsters are present (ex: distant monster noise).

## Monster Determination

To determine the type of monster encountered, roll a d6 and consult the result against the level of the dungeon (depth) in question. This will give you the "Threat Rank" (I - VI) of the monster, which you can then look up the appropriate (Equivalent) Hit Die range.

|**Dungeon Depth**|**d6 Result**|      |       |      |     |      ||**Threat Rank**|**Monster (Equivalent)<br>Hit Dice**|
|:----------------------|:-----------:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:---:|:----:|---|:---------------|:------------------------------------|
|1                      |1-4          |5     |6      |      |     |      ||**I**          |1 HD                                |
|2                      |1-2          |3-4   |5      |6     |     |      ||**II**         |2 HD                                |
|3-4                    |1            |2     |3-4    |5     |6    |      ||**III**        |3-4 HD                              |
|5-7                    |             |1     |2      |3-4   |5    |6     ||**IV**         |5-7 HD                              |
|8-10                   |             |      |1      |2     |3-4  |5-6   ||**V**          |8-10 HD                             |
|11                     |             |      |       |1     |2    |3-6   ||**VI**         |11+ HD                              |
|**Threat Rank**        |**I**        |**II**|**III**|**IV**|**V**|**VI**||               |                                    |


## Number Appearing

When stocking a dungeon, the numbers of monsters appearing is dependent on the relation between the Equivalent Hit Die of the creature and dungeon level/depth (presuming a traditional party of 4)

|EHD vs Dungeon Level|No of monsters appearing|
|:-------------------|:-----------------------|
|Dungeon level is greater by 3 or more    | (1d4+1)*3 or ~2 3/4 party size |
|Dungeon level is greater by 1 or 2  | (1d4+1)*2 or ~ 1 3/4 party size|
|Dungeon level and EHD are equal     | 1d4+1 or equal to party size |
|EHD is greater by 1 or 2      | (1d4+1)/2 or 1/2 party size    |
|EHD is greater by 3 or more   | (1d4+1)/3 or 1/4 party size    |

For a wandering monster encounter, cut the above number in half.

For a more detailed breakdown of this formula and approach, see:

## Monster Equivalent Hit Dice

This is a measure of monster threat that can be slotted into monster determination formula (in place of the Hit Die) providing a more accurate distribution of challenges.
