# Monsters

OED uses the monsters presented in Vol II with the adjustments below.

## Monster Information

**Hit Dice**: All monsters use a d6 for their base Hit Dice, which is
used to calculate combat abilities.

**Equivalent Hit Dice**: Monsters in OED have an Equivalent Hit Dice
value that takes into account their special abilities and relative
power. This is used to determine monster encounters and XP rewards.

**Attacks**: Monster attacks are resolved by d20 + Hit Die + Target AC >=
20. Monsters get a single attack per round unless otherwise noted.

**Monster Damage**: Monster damage is determined on a 1d6, unless
otherwise noted.

**Monster Strength**: If necessary, you can assume a Monster's Strength
modifier is equal to ½ its Hit Die.

**Magic to Hit**: For every 4 *natural* Hit Die a creature possesses, it
is capable of harming creatures that normally require +1 magic weapon to
hit.

**Languages**: It is assumed than an intelligent creature has a base 1
in 6 chance to speak common.

**Gaze Attacks**: Creatures facing beings with Gaze Attacks must make a
Save each round unless precautions are taken.

**Chimera/Gorgons**: Each round roll a 2d6, a result of 7+ means the
creature will use its breath weapon. It can use its breath weapon a
total of 3 times per day.

**Dragons**: Divide the Dragon's HP by 3 to determine its Hit Dice. Use
this Hit Dice value to determine Attacks and Saves. Each round roll a
2d6, a result of 7+ means the creature will use its breath weapon. It
can use its breath weapon a total of 3 times per day. A Dragon's breath
weapon does 1 die of damage for every 6 hit points it currently
possesses. Dragons can force a morale check on NPCs within 75 feet. They
have a 2 in 6 chance to detect creatures within 75 feet. Dragon subdual
rules are not used.

**Goblin-kin**: Goblins, Orcs, and Kobolds suffer a -4 to attack, and -1
to Morale in full daylight.

**Giants**: Giants can throw a stone every other round at ranges of of
100' to 140'. Giant melee attacks are 1d10 +Str bonus. Giant garb is
equivalent to Leather armor on top of naturally tough skin (+3 AC).

**Horses**: Non-Warhorses are unusable in combat, near to fire or
smells, etc. (auto-fail morale)

**Slimes**: Successful attacks by these creatures will cause metal to
corrode instantly. Metal weapons used against them will corrode on a
successful attack. Wood is consumed at too slow a rate to affect combat.

**Undead**: Undead are (mostly) immune to backstabs, critical hits,
death effects, and mental attacks.

**Skeletons**: Skeletons are 1 Hit Die monsters

**Vampires**: Vampires can summon 1d10 Rats (AC 7, Mv 75', HD 1/6 (1HP),
Att +0, Dmg 1) or 3d6 Wolves (AC 7, Mv 90', HD 2+2, Att +1, Dmg 1d6)

**Zombies**: Zombies are 2 Hit Die monsters

## Monster Placement

Within the dungeon, there is a 2 in 6 chance a monster is present in any
unallocated space (See Monster Determination below)

## Wandering Monsters

**Checks**: Make a 1 in 6 check for wandering monsters using the below
guidelines:

-   Every 15 minutes of real time play.
-   During long searches, such as those for secret doors, etc.
-   On the parties exit from dungeon.
-   In the presence of loud/combat noise.

If a wandering monster result is indicated, use the Monster
Determination information below. Multiple parties of monsters may attack
one another. On a near miss (result of 5), give a hint that monsters are
present (ex: distant monster noise).

## Monster Determination

To determine the type of monster encountered, roll a d6 and consult the
result against the level of the dungeon (depth) in question. This will
give you the "Threat" rank (I -- VI) of the monster.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Dungeon Level        **d6 Result**

## Number Appearing

When stocking a dungeon, the numbers of monsters appearing dependent on
the relation between the Equivalent Hit Die of the creature and dungeon
level (presuming a traditional party of 4)

  EHD vs Dungeon Level           No of monsters appearing
  ------------------------------ --------------------------
  Dungeon is greater by 3 or     (1d4+1)\*3 (11)
  Dungeon is greater by 1 or 2   (1d4+1)\*2 (7)
  Equal                          1d4+1 (4)
  EHD is greater by 1 or 2       (1d4+1)/2 (2)
  EHD is greater by 3 or more    (1d4+1)/3 (1)

For a wandering monster encounter, cut the above number in half.

For a more detailed breakdown of this formula and approach, see:
[Underworld Overhaul, Pt. 4: Monster Numbers Appearing](https://deltasdnd.blogspot.com/2018/05/underworld-overhaul-pt-4-monster.html)

## Monster Equivalent Hit Dice

This is a measure of monster threat that can be slotted into monster
determination for a more accurate distribution of challenges. An \*
indicates The EHD for this creature is highly situational.
